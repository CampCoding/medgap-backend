The inflammatory cascade leads to increased capillary permeability, pulmonary edema, surfactant dysfunction, and alveolar collapse. This creates a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, severe hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy, and decreased lung compliance. Clinically, patients present with acute onset of severe dyspnea, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mmHg, typically requiring mechanical ventilation. | Explanation: ARDS results from diffuse alveolar damage triggered by direct or indirect lung injury.

Question Text: Explain the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and its role in blood pressure regulation | Type: essay | Options: N/A | Correct Option: N/A | Difficulty: hard | Tags: physiology, cardiology | Keywords: RAAS, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, blood pressure, regulation | Hint: Consider the hormonal cascade from kidney to systemic effects | Help: Describe how RAAS maintains fluid and electrolyte balance and blood pressure | Explanation: The RAAS begins when reduced renal perfusion stimulates renin release from juxtaglomerular cells. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which ACE converts to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulates aldosterone secretion (promoting sodium and water retention), and increases ADH release. This system maintains blood pressure and fluid balance, but overactivity contributes to hypertension and heart failure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs target this pathway. | Explanation: The RAAS begins when reduced renal perfusion stimulates renin release from juxtaglomerular cells.

Mechanisms include enzymatic inactivation, target site modification, efflux pumps, or reduced permeability. Combat strategies include antimicrobial stewardship (appropriate antibiotic use), infection prevention, development of new antibiotics, combination therapy, rapid diagnostics to guide treatment, vaccination to prevent infections, and public education about proper antibiotic use. | Explanation: Antibiotic resistance occurs through genetic mutations or acquisition of resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer (plasmids, transposons).

It's effective against extracellular pathogens. Cell-mediated immunity involves T cells (helper CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+) that directly kill infected cells, activate macrophages, and coordinate immune responses.

It typically presents acutely in youth with polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and requires lifelong insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, often presents gradually in adults, is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, and can be managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, and sometimes insulin.

Pathogens trigger immune cells to release cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6), causing systemic inflammation, endothelial damage, increased vascular permeability, microvascular thrombosis, and organ dysfunction. Septic shock occurs when sepsis leads to circulatory and metabolic abnormalities with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors.

They're used for hypertension, angina, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Side effects include bradycardia, fatigue, and bronchospasm. Calcium channel blockers inhibit calcium entry into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation and reduced contractility. They treat hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias.

Consequences include cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac contractility, hyperkalemia, and impaired enzyme function. Compensation occurs through respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation to lower PaCO2) and renal mechanisms (increased H+ secretion, bicarbonate regeneration). The anion gap helps distinguish causes. Treatment addresses the underlying cause and may require bicarbonate administration in severe cases. | Explanation: Metabolic acidosis results from increased acid production (ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis), decreased acid excretion (renal failure), or bicarbonate loss (diarrhea).

Emphysema is characterized by destruction of alveolar walls, reduced surface area for gas exchange, and loss of elastic recoil, leading to hyperinflation. Chronic bronchitis involves chronic inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and excessive mucus production causing airway obstruction. Both are usually caused by smoking and share features like chronic inflammation, but emphysema primarily affects gas exchange while chronic bronchitis causes productive cough and mucus hypersecretion. Most patients have features of both. | Explanation: COPD involves persistent airflow limitation.

Opioids (morphine, fentanyl) bind mu receptors in the CNS, reducing neurotransmitter release and pain perception. NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) inhibit cyclooxygenase, reducing prostaglandin production and inflammation. Acetaminophen's mechanism is less clear but may involve central COX inhibition. Local anesthetics block sodium channels, preventing nerve conduction. Each class targets different points in the pain pathway. | Explanation: Pain transmission involves nociceptor activation, signal transmission via A-delta and C fibers to the spinal cord, and ascending pathways to the brain.

Treatment includes thrombolytics (tPA within 4.5 hours) and mechanical thrombectomy. Hemorrhagic stroke involves bleeding into brain tissue, causing direct damage and increased intracranial pressure. Treatment focuses on blood pressure control, reversal of anticoagulants, and sometimes surgical evacuation. Both present with sudden neurological deficits, but CT scan distinguishes them. Time is critical for ischemic stroke treatment, while hemorrhagic stroke requires immediate blood pressure management and potentially surgical intervention. | Explanation: Ischemic stroke (87% of cases) results from arterial occlusion causing brain infarction.
